            <p>
                <strong>Hi!</strong> I'm an aspiring game designer with a love for tabletop games, cooking, and storytelling. This site will eventually host my portfolio of all my projects in my career. For now, it will be a site for all my applied skills from IGME235. Presentation is one of the most important skills in game design, and I hope to become better at it through the class. I am currently in my second year at RIT, and lately I have been exploring the narrative side of game design. I grew up playing RPGs like Skyrim, Final Fantasy, and Xenoblade Chronicles, and their worlds & characters have always been the most enamoring aspects for me. And lately, there has been a boom for narrative-focused games in the industry with titles such as <i>The Last of Us</i> and <i>The Forgotten City</i>. When I graduate from RIT, I hope to establish myself within narrative design, and immerse generations to come.
