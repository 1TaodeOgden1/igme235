    <h2>Design Process</h2>

<p>
    As my first attempt at a portfolio, I had a pretty broad audience in mind. I wanted the site to look professional, 
    but also have a bit of personality. This also extended to my color scheme; I wanted something between flashy and 'corporate', 
    and ultimately settled on a palette based on my portrait shot. I noticed that screen-wide landing images were trending in
    all the published portfolios I browsed. So far, I think the 2-column style gallery works as a first try, although I would change 
    it into a carousel or something more decorative.
