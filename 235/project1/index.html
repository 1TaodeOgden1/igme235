                <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm a learning game designer on my second year at the Rochester Institute of Technology, with a particular for the narrative side of games. I grew up playing RPGs like Skyrim, Final Fantasy, and Xenoblade Chronicles, and their worlds & characters have always been the most enamoring aspects for me. When I'm not working on my latest projects, I am practicing my cooking, in the midst of a Dungeons & Dragons session, or stuck in a book. </p>
